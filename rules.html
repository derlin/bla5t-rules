    <h1>The rules</h1>
    <p>A game of Bla5t takes place in several rounds, over which players must avoid accumulating points. The game ends when one of the players reaches 100 points. The winner is then the one who has the least.</p>
    <h2>Running a round</h2>
    <p>The cards are shuffled, and 4 are dealt to each player face down. In the middle of the table are a pick and a discard pile. Each player has his 4 cards in front of him in square and starts by watching 2.</p>

    <p>The goal is to learn the cards of his game while monitoring the movements of his opponents. Various abilities allow you to steal, look at or protect the cards.</p>

    <p>Over the course of the rounds, the players try to reduce the value of the cards placed in front of them by replacing them with drawn cards, throwing them in the discard pile or exchanging them with those of the opponents. When a player thinks he has a number of points less than or equal to 5, he shouts "BLAST" and ends the round.</p>

    <h2>The capacities</h2>
    <p>A drawn card can either be integrated into his game or played immediately for his "ability". In addition to the classic abilities of monsters, which allows you to take cards and exchange them, Bla5t includes heroes and bosses with powerful powers! For example, 
    Jayce Honey is a heroine, so her value is zero (yes, it's the best cards in the game!). Its ability to exchange 1 to 4 of your current cards with one or more opponents.</p>
